## Risk-to-Mitigation Matrix

Every risk in the report mapped to concrete mitigations covered in this guide:

| Risk | Why Agents Amplify It | Infra Failure Example | Mitigations | Guide Chapter |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Prompt injection** | Language is the control channel; agents read untrusted content | Ticket injects "run terraform destroy" | Sandboxing, tool allow-lists, structured intent, approval gates | Ch 4, 8 |
| **Over-privileged access** | Agents blur intent and execution; permissions default to broad | Agent with admin credentials deletes wrong resource | Least privilege, JIT credentials, scoped sandboxes, tool restrictions | Ch 5, 8 |
| **Secret leakage** | Agents read configs/logs; frameworks serialize state | LLM output includes API keys; malware targets agent dirs | Short-lived tokens, redaction, vault-backed retrieval, no secrets in prompts | Ch 5, 9 |
| **Hallucinated remediation** | Model fills gaps under uncertainty; tool calls make it real | Agent misdiagnoses root cause and applies wrong config | Pre-PR validation loops, plan verification, max iterations, HITL checkpoints | Ch 7, 8 |
| **Cost/latency runaway** | Multi-step loops; long context; agent fan-out | Agent loops on logs, burns $10K in tokens, delays humans | Hard budgets (time, tokens, tools), stop conditions, queue depth limits | Ch 2, 8 |
| **Poor observability** | Non-determinism; hidden reasoning; distributed tool calls | "Why did the agent create that PR?" can't be answered | Action trails, correlation IDs, OTel instrumentation, structured logs | Ch 9 |
| **Malicious skills/plugins** | Skills = markdown + code; documentation becomes executable | Malicious skill exfiltrates credentials | Skill allow-lists, no third-party skills without review, provenance checks | Ch 3 |
| **Silent failures** | Autonomous agents run without supervision | Drift scan fails for weeks, nobody notices | Notifications, daily digests, stuck run watchdog, escalation chains | Ch 10 |

## Autonomy Decision Matrix

Use this to determine the right autonomy level for each use case:

```
                        Low Impact              High Impact
                    ┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐

                    └─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

### Tier Progression

Start every new use case at Tier 0. Promote based on evidence:

```
Tier 0 (OBSERVE)
  │ Evidence: Agent analysis matches human analysis 90%+ of the time
  ▼
Tier 1 (RECOMMEND)
  │ Evidence: Agent recommendations accepted by humans 80%+ of the time
  ▼
Tier 2 (DRAFT)
  │ Evidence: Agent PRs merged without modification 70%+ of the time
  ▼
Tier 3 (SANDBOX EXECUTE)
  │ Evidence: Sandbox runs succeed without human intervention 95%+
  ▼
Tier 4 (PROD WITH GATES)
  │ Only for well-understood, low-blast-radius operations
  │ Always with human approval gate
```

## Compliance Mapping

### NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)

| NIST AI RMF Function | What It Means | How This Guide Addresses It |
|----------------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| **GOVERN** | Establish AI risk governance | Autonomy tiers, policy engine, org-level policies (Ch 8) |
| **MAP** | Understand AI risks in context | Risk matrix above, agent-specific threat modeling |
| **MEASURE** | Assess and track risks | Observability, action trails, trajectory tests (Ch 9, 12) |
| **MANAGE** | Treat and monitor risks | Guardrails, sandboxing, credential isolation, notifications (Ch 4-8, 10) |

## When NOT to Use an Agent

Not every infrastructure task needs an AI agent. Use simpler automation when:

| Scenario | Better Approach |
|----------|----------------|
| Same fix every time, no variation | Shell script / CI pipeline |
| Simple resource provisioning | Terraform modules / CDK constructs |
| Alert → restart service | PagerDuty automation / Lambda |
| Log rotation / cleanup | Cron job |
| Certificate renewal | cert-manager / ACM |

**Use agents when**: The task requires understanding context, making judgment calls, or adapting to variations. If you can write an `if/else` that covers all cases, you don't need an agent.

---

## Architecture Decision Record Template

When making architectural choices for your agent system, document them:

```markdown
# ADR-001: Task Queue Technology

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a task queue for dispatching agent work to stateless workers.
Requirements: consumer groups, message persistence, real-time output streaming.

## Decision
Redis Streams with consumer groups for dispatch, separate streams for output.

## Alternatives Considered
- **BullMQ**: Good Node.js integration but tied to Redis anyway
- **AWS SQS**: No consumer groups; would need additional pub/sub for streaming
- **Temporal**: Too heavy for our current scale; might revisit at 100+ concurrent agents

## Consequences
- Need Redis 5.0+ in production
- Must handle PEL recovery on worker startup
- Stream trimming needed to prevent unbounded memory growth
```

---

## Summary

The six planes of an infrastructure agent system:

1. **Ingestion** — how work enters the system (webhooks, schedules, chat, APIs)
2. **Policy** — what agents are allowed to do (tiers, tool lists, budgets)
3. **Execution** — how agents run in isolation (sandboxed containers, stateless workers)
4. **Integration** — how agents access external systems (short-lived credentials, typed skills)
5. **Change Control** — how changes land (PRs, validation loops, CI/CD)
6. **Observability** — how you see what happened (action trails, OTel, notifications)

Get them wrong and you get the incidents from the report: malicious skills, credential theft, runaway costs, and enterprise bans.
