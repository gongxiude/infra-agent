# Chapter 3: Tools, CLIs & Skills

> How agents gain capabilities — from CLI tools to structured skill systems.

---

## The Tool Landscape

Infrastructure agents need access to real tools: `terraform`, `aws`, `az`, `gcloud`, `kubectl`, `helm`, `git`, `checkov`, `tflint`, and dozens more. The question isn't whether agents need tools — it's how to provide access safely.

There's a spectrum from raw shell access (maximum power, minimum safety) to structured skill systems (constrained power, maximum safety). Most production systems use a combination.

---

## CLI Tools: The Foundation

Every infrastructure agent ultimately needs to run CLI commands. The IaC ecosystem is built around CLIs — there's no Terraform API that replaces `terraform plan`, no Azure SDK that replaces everything `az` does. The agent's sandbox image is its tool inventory.

### Essential CLI Tooling

| Category | Tools | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **IaC** | `terraform`, `tofu`, `pulumi`, `bicep` | Write, plan, validate infrastructure code |
| **Cloud CLIs** | `aws`, `az`, `gcloud`, `oci` | Query resources, manage configurations |
| **Kubernetes** | `kubectl`, `helm`, `kustomize` | Cluster operations, deployments |
| **Git** | `git`, `gh`, `glab` | Version control, PR creation |
| **Security** | `checkov`, `tflint`, `trivy`, `prowler` | Static analysis, compliance scanning |
| **Utilities** | `jq`, `yq`, `curl`, `envsubst` | Data parsing, HTTP calls, templating |

### Making CLI Access Safe

Giving an agent unrestricted `bash` is the simplest approach and the most dangerous. Here's how to tighten it:

**1. Allowlisted commands**: Only permit specific binaries. The agent can run `terraform plan` but not arbitrary `curl` or `bash -c`.

**2. Credential injection via environment**: CLIs read credentials from environment variables. Inject short-lived tokens at runtime rather than baking anything into the image:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID + AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY + AWS_SESSION_TOKEN  (STS)
AZURE_CLIENT_ID + AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET + AZURE_TENANT_ID       (Service Principal)
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS                                  (Service Account)
GITHUB_TOKEN                                                    (Installation token)
```

See [Chapter 5: Credential Management](./05-credential-management.md) for the full credential broker pattern.

**3. Version pinning**: Pin every tool to a specific version in the sandbox Dockerfile. A Terraform upgrade from 1.8 to 1.9 can change plan output format, break providers, or introduce new behaviors.

**4. Machine-readable output**: CLI output is messy — progress bars, color codes, pagination, warnings mixed with data. Always prefer structured output:

```bash
terraform plan -json              # Structured JSON instead of human-readable
terraform show -json              # JSON state output
aws ... --output json             # JSON instead of table format
az ... --output json              # JSON instead of table format
kubectl get ... -o json           # JSON output
checkov -o json                   # JSON findings
```

When JSON output isn't available, the model parses text — which works but is fragile across tool versions.

**5. Typed CLI wrappers**: For high-risk or frequently-used commands, wrap the CLI in a typed function that validates inputs and parses outputs:

```typescript
interface PlanResult {
  success: boolean;
  resources: { address: string; action: 'create' | 'update' | 'delete' | 'no-op' }[];
  error?: string;
}

async function terraformPlan(workDir: string): Promise<PlanResult> {
  const { stdout, exitCode } = await exec(
    'terraform plan -json -no-color',
    { cwd: workDir }
  );
  return parsePlanJson(stdout);
}
```

This is the bridge between raw CLI and structured capabilities — the agent calls a typed function, but under the hood it's running `terraform plan`.

### CLI vs Structured Tools: When to Use Which

| Use CLI Directly | Use Typed Wrappers / Skills |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| One-off queries (`aws s3 ls`) | Core agent loop operations (plan, validate, PR) |
| Tool has good `-json` output | Output needs parsing or error classification |
| Low-risk read-only commands | High-risk write operations |
| Exploratory/debugging tasks | Repeated operations that must be reliable |

---

## Structured Capability Systems

Beyond CLIs, there are several ways to give agents higher-level, safer capabilities. A good system provides:

- **Documentation** — The agent understands what a capability does, when to use it, and what constraints apply
- **Typing** — Inputs and outputs have schemas, not arbitrary strings
- **Scoping** — Different agents get different capabilities. A PR reviewer shouldn't have `terraform apply`
- **Auditability** — Every invocation is logged with inputs, outputs, and context

### 1. Skills as Files (Document-First)

Write skills as files that the agent reads and executes. Popularized by Claude Code's `.claude/skills/` convention:

```
skills/
├── terraform-plan/
│   └── SKILL.md     # Instructions, constraints, examples
├── git-operations/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── cloud-credentials/
    └── SKILL.md
```

The agent reads `SKILL.md` to understand when and how to use the skill. Instructions can include constraints ("never run on production without approval"), error handling ("if plan times out, retry once"), and examples.

```markdown
# Terraform Plan Skill

## When to Use
After making changes to Terraform files, to validate your changes
produce the expected plan output.

## Constraints
- ALWAYS check the plan output before creating a PR
- If the plan shows unexpected changes, STOP and ask the user
- Maximum 10 plan iterations per session

## Error Handling
- If the pipeline fails, check the error output for syntax errors
- If authentication fails, request fresh credentials
```

**Pros**: Rich documentation; agent can reason about when to use a skill; easy to version-control and review; skills can be injected per-agent at runtime.
**Cons**: Requires the agent to parse and follow instructions (model-dependent); less structured than typed function calls.

### 2. Subagents as Role-Scoped Capability Bundles

Subagents package an agent role into a reusable definition: prompt, model, tool scope, permission mode, max turns, skills, hooks, and MCP access. In Claude Code, these can live at multiple scopes:

| Scope | Typical Use |
|-------|-------------|
| **Managed / enterprise** | Organization-wide baseline roles and restrictions |
| **Project** (`.claude/agents/`) | Repository-specific reviewers, remediators, and workflow helpers |
| **User** (`~/.claude/agents/`) | Personal helpers available across projects |
| **Plugin / marketplace** | Packaged roles distributed with related skills and integrations |

Managed subagents are especially relevant for infrastructure teams because they can cover several layers at once:

- **Role layer** — `security-reviewer`, `terraform-reviewer`, `drift-remediator`, `incident-triage`
- **Prompt layer** — role-specific instructions, review criteria, and escalation rules
- **Runtime layer** — model choice, effort level, max turns, and delegation boundaries
- **Capability layer** — allowed tools, preloaded skills, and scoped MCP servers
- **Governance layer** — enterprise-managed definitions can override unsafe project or user variants

This makes managed subagents a practical enterprise control for standardizing how agents behave across repositories. They do **not** replace sandboxing, credential brokering, approval gates, deterministic validation, or action trails. Treat them as a high-level role/capability policy that still needs lower-level enforcement.

For multi-tenant products, the same pattern applies even if you don't use Claude Code directly: store resolved agent definitions as versioned artifacts, review them like policy, and make the effective role configuration visible per run.

### 3. MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Anthropic's open standard for connecting agents to external tools and data sources. In practice, MCP has grown from "typed tool bridge" into a broader interoperability layer for **tools, resources, prompts, and long-running task flows**. MCP servers are typically exposed over stdio or HTTP transports:

```typescript
import { McpServer } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server';

const server = new McpServer({ name: 'infra-tools' });

server.tool('terraform_plan',
  { pipelineId: z.string() },
  async ({ pipelineId }) => {
    const result = await triggerPlan(pipelineId);
    return { content: [{ type: 'text', text: JSON.stringify(result) }] };
  }
);
```

Modern MCP deployments may also include:

- **Structured outputs** so tool results don't have to be parsed from plain text
- **Elicitation / user-input flows** for agent questions
- **Task-oriented operations** for long-running work instead of single request/response calls
- **Registry metadata** for discovery and installation
- **Authorization conventions** so clients can negotiate OAuth and related flows consistently

**Pros**: Standard protocol; typed schemas; supported by multiple LLM providers; fast-growing ecosystem of vendor and community servers.
**Cons**: Still requires operational discipline: version pinning, auth hardening, allowlists, and compatibility testing across clients.

**Operational guidance**:

- Pin both the **server version** and the **MCP spec version** you tested against
- Treat registry presence as **discoverability**, not trust
- Prefer an **internal registry or allowlist** for production
- Treat tool descriptions and annotations as untrusted input until reviewed

### 4. A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocols)

MCP is not the right abstraction for every integration. When one agent needs to delegate to another autonomous application with its own memory, approvals, artifacts, and lifecycle, use an **agent-to-agent protocol** such as **A2A**.

Use **A2A** when:

- the remote system owns its own credentials and policy enforcement
- work is long-running and task-oriented
- responses may include artifacts, status changes, follow-up questions, or resumable work items

Use **MCP** when:

- you are exposing tools, resources, or prompts to a model runtime
- calls are narrow, typed, and subordinate to the calling agent

In practice, many infra systems use **MCP inside a worker** and **A2A across product boundaries**.

### 5. LangChain / LangGraph Tools

Python-native tool registration with decorators:

```python
from langchain.tools import tool

@tool
def terraform_plan(pipeline_id: str) -> str:
    """Trigger a Terraform plan and return the result."""
    result = requests.post(f"{API_URL}/run-pipeline", json={"id": pipeline_id})
    return result.json()

agent = create_react_agent(llm, [terraform_plan, ...])
```

**Pros**: Simple Python-native API; large ecosystem; works with any LLM.
**Cons**: Python-only; tool docs limited to docstrings; no built-in isolation.

### 6. OpenAI-Style Function Calling

Define tools as JSON schemas, let the model generate structured arguments:

```typescript
const tools = [{
  type: 'function',
  function: {
    name: 'terraform_plan',
    description: 'Trigger a Terraform plan execution',
    parameters: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        pipeline_id: { type: 'string', description: 'The pipeline to run' },
      },
      required: ['pipeline_id'],
    },
  },
}];
```

**Pros**: Model generates validated JSON; clean separation between schema and execution.
**Cons**: Schema-only documentation (no rich instructions); tied to providers that support function calling.

### Comparison

| Approach | Documentation | Typing | Isolation | Ecosystem |
|----------|--------------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **CLI tools** (direct) | Man pages / `--help` | None (strings) | Sandbox-level | Entire IaC ecosystem |
| **Typed CLI wrappers** | Code comments | Strong | Sandbox-level | Build your own |
| **Skills as files** | Rich (full markdown) | Via code | Per-file | Growing (Claude, community) |
| **Subagents / agent roles** | Role prompt + frontmatter/config | Via configured tools | Per-agent/session | Growing in Claude-style runtimes |
| **MCP** | Schema + description | Strong (Zod) | Per-server | Growing fast (vendor-backed) |
| **A2A** | Agent cards + task schema | Strong | App boundary | Emerging interoperability layer |
| **LangChain tools** | Docstrings | Python types | None (same process) | Largest |
| **Function calling** | Schema only | JSON Schema | Your responsibility | Universal |

### Combining Approaches: Subagents + Skills + MCP + A2A + CLIs

These approaches aren't mutually exclusive — they layer together:

- **CLIs** are the foundation. The agent runs `terraform`, `aws`, `git` in its sandbox. This is the raw capability layer.
- **Skills** define *how* to use those CLIs well. A skill says "when writing Terraform, follow these conventions, validate with plan, max 10 iterations." It's the best-practices layer.
- **Subagents / managed agent roles** package *who* is doing the work: role prompt, model, allowed tools, skills, MCP access, and safety posture. They can cover parts of the runtime, capability, and policy layers at the same time.
- **MCP** connects to *live data and APIs*. An MCP server gives the agent access to the Terraform Registry, workspace state, or cloud resource inventory. It's the data layer.
- **A2A** connects to *other autonomous systems*. A remote remediation agent, ticketing copilot, or approval service can own its own state while still participating in a broader workflow.

HashiCorp's Claude plugin demonstrates three of these layers directly: CLI tools installed in the environment, skills for Terraform code generation patterns, and an MCP server for live Terraform Registry and Cloud API access.

## Tool Allow/Deny Lists

Restrict what tools each agent type can access:

```typescript
// Example agent configurations
const AGENT_CONFIGS = {
  'pr-reviewer': {
    allowedTools: ['git-diff', 'pr-comment', 'iac-lint'],
    maxTurns: 20,
    producesCodeChanges: false,
  },
  'compliance-remediation': {
    allowedTools: [],  // All tools (needs to write code, run plans, create PRs)
    maxTurns: 50,
    producesCodeChanges: true,
  },
  'drift-detection': {
    allowedTools: ['terraform-plan', 'drift-verification', 'notify-slack'],
    maxTurns: 10,
    producesCodeChanges: false,
  },
};
```

The key principle: **start restrictive, expand as needed.** A drift detection agent doesn't need git push. A PR reviewer doesn't need cloud credentials.

## Real-World IaC Skills Ecosystem

Vendors, cloud providers, and the community have published production-grade skills and MCP servers. You can adopt them directly, use them as templates, or just study the patterns.

### The Agent Skills Format

The standard format — popularized by [Anthropic's skills spec](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) (72K+ stars) — is structurally simple: a directory with a required `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter (name, description) plus optional scripts and assets. The frontmatter follows a **three-level progressive disclosure** model:

```yaml
---
# Level 1: Frontmatter (always loaded into agent context for discovery)
name: terraform-style-guide
description: Write and review Terraform following HashiCorp style conventions
---

# Level 2: SKILL.md body (loaded on demand when skill is activated)
## When to Use
Use when writing new Terraform configurations or reviewing existing HCL...

## Instructions
Follow these conventions...

## References
- [reference: ./hashicorp-style-guide.md]  # Level 3: linked files (loaded when needed)
```

The agent loads full instructions only when a skill is activated — names and descriptions stay in context for discovery.

For multi-tenant products, resolve skills and role definitions in **layers**:

1. vendor-curated or platform-curated base skills
2. organization-level overrides and custom skills
3. repository-local skills for team-specific workflows

Version the resolved skill and subagent set, cache it, and make the active manifest inspectable in logs and UI. This matters as much as the individual file content.

### Vendor-Official Skills

#### HashiCorp — [hashicorp/agent-skills](https://github.com/hashicorp/agent-skills)

The most complete vendor skill set for Terraform. Organized into three plugin bundles:

| Plugin | Skills Included | Focus |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| `terraform-code-generation` | `terraform-style-guide`, `terraform-test`, `azure-verified-modules` | Writing correct HCL, testing |
| `terraform-module-generation` | `refactor-module`, `terraform-stacks` | Module extraction, HCP Terraform Stacks |
| `terraform-provider-development` | `new-terraform-provider`, `provider-actions`, `provider-resources` | Building Terraform providers |

The `refactor-module` skill is notable because it covers **state migration patterns** (`moved` blocks, `terraform state mv`) — high blast radius if executed incorrectly. The `terraform-stacks` skill explicitly recommends **workload identity (OIDC)** and ephemeral tokens.

#### Pulumi — [pulumi/agent-skills](https://github.com/pulumi/agent-skills)

Covers both authoring and migration workflows:

| Category | Skills | Focus |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Authoring** | `pulumi-best-practices`, `pulumi-component`, `pulumi-automation-api`, `pulumi-esc` | Writing Pulumi programs, ESC secrets management |
| **Migration** | `pulumi-terraform-to-pulumi`, `cloudformation-to-pulumi`, `pulumi-cdk-to-pulumi`, `pulumi-arm-to-pulumi` | Full migration workflows with state translation |

The migration skills emphasize a **"zero-diff preview" requirement** — after importing state, the Pulumi preview must show no changes before considering the migration successful. This is a key safety pattern for any state migration skill.

### Vendor MCP Servers

#### HashiCorp — [hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server)

Provides live access to the Terraform ecosystem via MCP:
- **Terraform Registry**: query providers, modules, policies
- **Terraform Cloud/Enterprise**: workspace CRUD, run management, private registry
- Supports both `stdio` and `StreamableHTTP` transports

> **Security note**: The repo explicitly warns to restrict `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to mitigate cross-origin/DNS rebinding attacks, and recommends local-only use with trusted clients.

#### AWS — [awslabs/mcp](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp)

The AWS MCP monorepo (8K+ stars) contains three IaC-relevant servers:

| Server | Capabilities | Risk Level |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **aws-iac-mcp-server** | CloudFormation/CDK docs search, template validation, compliance checks, deployment troubleshooting | Low (read-only, guidance) |
| **cfn-mcp-server** | Direct CRUD of 1,100+ AWS resource types via Cloud Control API, IaC Generator | **Very High** (can create/delete resources) |
| **terraform-mcp-server** | AWS Terraform best practices, Checkov scanning, `terraform plan/apply/destroy` execution | **Very High** (can run apply/destroy) |

> **Critical distinction**: `aws-iac-mcp-server` is guidance-only and safe. `cfn-mcp-server` and `terraform-mcp-server` can make destructive changes — treat them as Tier 3/4 tools requiring explicit approval gates.

#### Pulumi MCP Server

Available as `@pulumi/mcp-server` on npm and `docker pull mcp/pulumi`. Interacts with Pulumi Cloud for stack preview, deploy, output retrieval, and registry queries. Requires OAuth flow and Pulumi Access Token with org scoping.

## Skill Supply Chain Security

Skills are not "just documentation." They are **executable procedures** that induce tool calls, shell commands, and credential exposure. The industry learned this the hard way:

- **Malicious skill marketplaces**: mass uploads of stealer malware disguised as useful skills
- **"Markdown is an installer"**: a skill's setup instructions led to malicious infrastructure and a staged payload chain
- **Prompt injection via skills**: instructions embedded in SKILL.md can manipulate agent behavior
- **Remote content fetching**: skills that `curl` external URLs at runtime are indirect injection vectors

### Vetting Checklist for IaC Skills

```
BEFORE INSTALLING ANY SKILL:

[ ] Source is vendor-official or from a known, trusted publisher
[ ] Registry entry or marketplace presence is treated as discovery, not trust
[ ] Reviewed SKILL.md for suspicious instructions (fetch URLs, run scripts, disable security)
[ ] No embedded scripts that execute on install or setup
[ ] No references to external URLs that fetch content at runtime
[ ] Pinned to a specific version/commit hash (never "latest")
[ ] Pinned MCP server image/package/version if the skill depends on MCP
[ ] If from a marketplace: check scanning results, publisher history, star count
[ ] If it touches credentials: verify it recommends OIDC/short-lived tokens, not static keys
[ ] If it can run apply/destroy: ensure it's behind approval gates in your system

ONGOING:

[ ] Re-scan periodically (skills can be updated maliciously)
[ ] Monitor for CVEs in skill dependencies
[ ] Maintain an internal allowlist of approved skills
[ ] Mirror critical skills and MCP servers into an internal registry when possible
[ ] Block unknown publishers by default
```

### The Safe Default: Read-Only + PR-First

For IaC skills, the safe adoption posture is:

1. **In development**: Skills can generate code and propose diffs
2. **In CI**: Skills can run `plan`/`preview`/`validate` and produce reports
3. **In production**: Skills open PRs — they never `apply` directly
4. **For apply/destroy**: Require explicit "break-glass" approval with separate credentials

This matches how the vendor skills are designed: HashiCorp's skills produce guidance and encourage plan verification; Pulumi's migration skills mandate "zero-diff preview" before considering success.
