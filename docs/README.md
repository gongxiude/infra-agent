> How to design, build, and operate AI agents for infrastructure teams — safely.

AI agents can write IaC, fix compliance findings, detect drift, review PRs, and respond to incidents — all autonomously. But autonomy without guardrails is a liability. Agents that can `terraform apply` can also `terraform destroy`. Agents that read configs can leak secrets. Agents that loop can burn budgets.

**This guide covers every architectural decision** you need to make when building infrastructure agents — with real patterns, code snippets, multiple alternatives, and the risk framework to evaluate your choices.

## Who This Is For

- **Platform engineers** evaluating whether to build or buy agent capabilities
- **SREs** designing safe automation for incident response and remediation
- **DevOps leads** building self-service IaC platforms
- **Engineering leaders** who need a reviewed architecture for AI-driven infrastructure

## Core Principles

1. **Agents Default to PR-First Change Control** — Every infrastructure change flows through a pull request. The agent produces diffs, not deployments. If you support direct execution at all, treat it as a separate break-glass architecture with separate credentials, approval paths, and audit controls.
2. **Least Privilege by Default** — Agents get the minimum credentials and tool access needed. Privileges are scoped, time-limited, and auditable.
3. **Observability Is Not Optional** — Every tool call, credential request, and decision point is logged and traced end-to-end.
4. **Fail Safe, Not Fail Open** — When in doubt, the agent stops and asks a human. Timeouts and policy gates are structural — not suggestions.
5. **The Agent Is Not Special** — Agent-initiated changes go through the same review, CI, and deployment pipelines as human-initiated changes.

## About

This guide is built by the team at **[Cloudgeni](https://cloudgeni.ai)**, where we design, build, and operate autonomous infrastructure agents in production across AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI for enterprise teams.

Every pattern here comes from running these systems in production. We open-sourced it because we kept answering the same architectural questions — writing them down once seemed more useful.
